# CLAUDE.md

This is the **frontend** repo for the Stock/HPP business-finance project.

## Project status

Stack chosen: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + TanStack Query. See
`stock-business-analyst/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-stack-architecture-design.md`
for the full design (UI/UX approach, data model, error handling).

## Relationship to sibling repos

This project is split across independent repos, each buildable and
deployable on its own with no shared code or path dependency between them:

- `stock-frontend` (this repo) — client-side UI
- `stock-backend` — API / business logic / data layer
- `stock-infrastructure` — CI/CD, deployment, IaC
- `stock-qa` — test plans, test automation
- `stock-business-analyst` — requirements, specs, source material (incl. the original HPP/business-finance notes)

Contracts between repos (API shapes, etc.) should be treated as external and
versioned/documented, not assumed from source.

## Working here

`.claude/` config (agents, hooks, skills, MCP) is kept identical across all
five repos on purpose, so any agent persona works the same way regardless of
which repo it's invoked in. Once a stack is chosen, update this file with
real build/lint/test commands and architecture notes.

## Skill Activation

At the start of any task-oriented session — any interaction where you will
use tools and produce deliverables — invoke the task-observer skill before
beginning work. This ensures skill improvement opportunities are captured
throughout the session.

When loading any skill, check the observation log for OPEN observations
tagged to that skill. Apply their insights to the current work, even if
the skill file hasn't been updated yet. This enables immediate application
of observations before they're permanently integrated during the weekly
review.

## Git

Do not commit changes in this repo automatically — even when using
atomic-commit or similar workflows. Only commit when the user explicitly
asks for it.

Never push directly to the `main` branch, even when explicitly asked to
"push" or "commit and push" — `main` is protected and requires a pull
request. Always push to a new branch and open a PR instead, across all
five `stock-*` repos.

Always branch off `main` for new work, and sync first: run
`git fetch origin && git merge --ff-only origin/main` (or
`git pull --ff-only`) before creating the branch — cutting a branch from a
stale local `main` produces a PR with a stale diff or spurious merge
conflicts.

## Code style

Always put comments in code so it is understandable by a human reader —
explain what non-obvious blocks (component logic, derived state, layout
decisions) do, not just restate the syntax.

## Environment files

Always use `.env.local` for local config — never create or reintroduce a
`.env.example`/`.env.sample` template file. `.env.local` already exists in
this repo (gitignored) and holds the real placeholder values directly; if a
new env var is needed, add it straight to `.env.local` (with a comment
explaining it) rather than adding a separate example file for someone to
copy from.

MCP servers configured in `.mcp.json` that reference `${VAR_NAME}` (e.g.
the `github` server needs `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`) read from the
process environment, which is not populated automatically. Before using
such an MCP server or making authenticated GitHub calls, read the value
out of this repo's `.env.local` (e.g.
`grep GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN .env.local`) and export it for the
current shell — don't assume it's already set.

## Gitignore

Always ensure a `.gitignore` exists in this repo — never let it be
deleted or skipped when scaffolding. It has two parts:

- A **shared baseline** kept identical (word-for-word) across all five
  `stock-*` repos: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.claude/settings.local.json`. If
  you add an entry to this shared baseline in any one repo, add the same
  line to the other four repos' `.gitignore` files too, so they stay in
  sync.
- **Repo-specific entries** below the baseline (e.g. `node_modules`,
  `dist` here; `__pycache__/`, `.venv/` in the Python repos) — these are
  expected to differ per repo's tooling and should NOT be copied to
  siblings.
